# de-jcup-eclipse-commons
# You will find the sources under https://github.com/de-jcup/eclipse-commons

A library containing reuseable eclipse solutions. This is a simple approach to resolve the
problem of too much copy & waste in de-jcup plugins. Some bigger and trick parts are bundled 
here as a simple library which can be used by plugins.

## Current version
0.4.0


## way to build
- currently build-library.jardesc is used (ugly but it works)
- version is not used (currently) in filenames to avoid version hopping (and versions
  are not 100% setup because not build by tool like maven or gradle)


# History:
