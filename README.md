# de-jcup-eclipse-commons

A library containing reuseable eclipse solutions  

## Current version
0.3.1

## way to build
- currently build-library.jardesc is used (ugly but it works)
- version is not used (currently) in filenames to avoid version hopping (and versions
  are not 100% setup because not build by tool like maven or gradle
